Budget Tracker by Madison Lee

Method: 50-20-30 Rule
50% of your money towards needs, 30% towards wants, 20% towards savings

Step 0:
Input total money --> program outputs where your money should go

Step 1:
Input home state --> Calculate post-tax dollars & whether one has 401k investment
3 types of taxes: income, property, goods+services <--- focus on income tax
- note only using NJ income tax rates
